# Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow (Coursera)

This repository contains the files and resources from the **Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow** course offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

## 📚 Course Overview

Over the span of four weeks, this course provided a comprehensive introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using TensorFlow and Keras. Topics covered include:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding, and sequencing for preparing raw text for neural networks.
- **Word Embeddings**: Understanding how to map words into vector space to capture semantic relationships.
- **Sequence Models**: Building RNNs and other sequence models to analyze sentiment and context in language.
- **Practical Project**: Leveraging sequence models and embeddings to build a **Poetry Generator**.

This repository contains the zipped project folder (`NLP.zip`) that includes all notebooks, models, and resources developed during the course.
